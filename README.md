# MyBB_Theme_FA7Dark

FA7Dark v1.1
» About:

Current FA 7 library: fontawesome-free-7.0.1-web


This theme for MyBB enthusiasts was originally made in FA5 version simply to allow for users having troubles with the Font Awesome 5 tutorials provided and found here: https://community.mybb.com/thread-220017.html This theme has now been converted to Font Awesome 7


* For anyone having trouble with any of the tutorials supplied in that thread..., well, here is simply the default theme with all colors, and a good majority of the tutorials in that thread applied in it.


NOTE: This is currently a WIP as I convert such to FA7 and while most is already done there may be some minor details that still need to be touched upon, but, I will get to such as I notice such, but, alas, I simply wanted to make such available asap, thus here it is "as is".
